# MindTrap2016FreeToPlay
This is the README file for MindTrap. Currently this branch has unrealstickfigure2D.exe  which is the only file other than this read me in here at the moment. I believe there are other files i need to upload so that you can play the game, however currently the file here is set up for 64bit windows with touch controls. this version also supports a game controller or keyboard input.
